# Potato Disease Classification using Deep Learning

This project focuses on classifying potato plant leaves into **healthy** or **diseased** categories using deep learning techniques. The goal is to assist farmers and researchers in identifying plant health conditions quickly and accurately.

## Project Structure
- **potato_dataset/** → Dataset used for training and testing  
- **training jupyter notebooks/** → Model training and experimentation  
- **saved_models/** → Trained model files  
- **api/** → Backend API for inference  
- **frontend/** → User interface to interact with the model  

## Features
- Preprocessed dataset of potato leaves  
- Deep learning model for disease classification  
- Trained models saved for reuse  
- Frontend + API for easy deployment and testing  

## Tech Stack
- Python, TensorFlow/Keras  
- Jupyter Notebooks  
- Streamlit/Flask for frontend & API  

## Usage
1. Clone the repository  
2. Train the model or use the pre-saved models  
3. Run the API and frontend to classify potato leaf images
